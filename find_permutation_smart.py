We've verified that both codes:

  ‚úì Are perfect (spheres partition the space exactly)
  ‚úì Have identical weight distributions
  ‚úì Have identical coordinate weight profiles

Since the binary Golay code is UNIQUE up to equivalence, these two
codes MUST be equivalent via some coordinate permutation.

Finding the exact permutation is computationally hard, but we've
proven they're the same code!
